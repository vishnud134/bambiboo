            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border/60">Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>
              Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of Your jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where required by applicable law, We will ensure that international transfers of Your Personal Data are subject to appropriate safeguards and, where relevant, supplementary measures. The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of Your data and other personal information.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border/60">Delete Your Personal Data</h3>

You may also contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Data that You have provided to Us.
            </p>
            <p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when We have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border/60">Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Business Transactions</h4>
            <p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground mt-4">Law Enforcement</h4>
            <p>
              Under certain circumstances, the Company may disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground mt-4">Other Legal Requirements</h4>
            <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
              <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
              <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border/60">Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>
              The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border/60">Children's and Minors' Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Service is not directed to, and We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from, anyone under the age of 16.</p>
            <p>
              If You are a parent or guardian and You believe Your child has provided Us with Personal Information, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Information from anyone under the age of 16, We will take steps to remove that information from Our servers as soon as reasonably possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some countries and states set a higher age at which an individual can consent to the processing of their own Personal Information. Where We rely on consent as a legal basis and the law applicable to a User sets an age higher than 16, We may require the consent of that User's parent or guardian before We collect and use their Personal Information.
            </p>
